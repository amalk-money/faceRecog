# faceRecog
In this project, I've demonstrated the face recognization using transfer learning technique.
Here I used the MobileNet pre trained model to create the model.

## sample collection
I used the harcascade pre trained model to detect the face and to provide the samples for the training and testing of model.

## Training
I used the MobileNet pre trained model and using which I created my own layers and appended to the layer.
More the dataset, better the prediction will be.
